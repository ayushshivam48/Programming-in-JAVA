# Programming in Java

## Introduction to Java

### 🌟 What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995.

The philosophy behind Java:
"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) – meaning you can write Java code once and run it on any platform that supports Java without needing to recompile.

### 🔧 Key Features of Java

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Simple            | Easy to learn, especially for those with C/C++ background                   |
| 🔒 Secure           | Provides strong memory management and avoids pointer-related issues         |
| 🔄 Object-Oriented  | Based on OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism         |
| 🌐 Platform Independent | Compiles into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)         |
| 🚀 Robust           | Strong exception handling and type checking                                 |
| 💡 Multithreaded    | Supports multithreaded programming (handling multiple tasks at once)        |
| ⚙️ High Performance | Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler improves performance                            |
| 🌍 Distributed      | Useful for distributed computing (e.g., RMI, EJB)                           |

### ⚙️ How Java Works
1. Source Code (.java) → Written by the programmer
2. Compiled into Bytecode (.class) using the Java Compiler (javac)
3. Bytecode is run on the JVM (java ClassName), making it platform-independent

Java Code → Compiled → Bytecode → JVM → Output

### 🧱 Basic Java Program Example


public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Explanation:
•	public class HelloWorld → Class declaration
•	public static void main → Entry point of the program
•	System.out.println() → Prints output to console

🧠 Java Editions
1.	Java SE (Standard Edition) – for core functionality (apps, desktop)
2.	Java EE (Enterprise Edition) – for web and enterprise apps (now Jakarta EE)
3.	Java ME (Micro Edition) – for embedded and mobile devices
