import java.util.Scanner;

public class W12_P2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read a single character input representing a calculator function key
        char key = sc.next().charAt(0);
System.out.println(mapFunction(key)); // Call the function-mapping method and print the result

/*
Explanation:
- The method mapFunction receives a calculator key as input and returns its corresponding function name.
- We pass the user input 'key' to this method and print the returned string.

Final Note:
This task demonstrates how programs convert low-level inputs (like characters) into meaningful user-facing actions.
Although the solution involves only one line of code, it ties together your understanding of method usage, return types, and function mapping.
Reaching this final stage of the course reflects consistent effort and growth.
We encourage you to explore how each helper method contributes to the program's clarity and structure.
Well done on completing Week 12.
